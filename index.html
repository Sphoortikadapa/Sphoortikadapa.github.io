        <p class="txt-contents">Addressing speculation that Oswald was a CIA agent or had some relationship with the Agency, the Warren Commission stated in 1964 that their investigation "revealed no evidence that Oswald was ever employed by the CIA in any capacity." The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported similarly in 1979 that "there was no indication in Oswald's CIA file that he had ever had contact with the Agency" and concluded that the CIA was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy.

            <p class="txt-contents">It is one of mountaineering’s most fiercely debated claims; that George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest.But new research suggests the pair could never have conquered the world’s highest mountain but were instead killed by a “perfect storm”.

                Experts claim that weather data collected at the time of the 1924 ascent shows the two Englishmen were enveloped in a blizzard which saw oxygen plunge to fatally low levels.
                
                The findings appear to confirm that New Zealander Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay were the first climbers to scale the 29,035ft peak, 29 years later.

                    Also known as the “Paul Is Dead” theory, it claims that The Beatles’ bass guitarist and vocalist actually passed away in 1969, and was replaced by a look-a-like. It all started with a rumor that McCartney had passed away in a traffic accident and it later escalated into a theory that the band was trying to hide the fact that Paul is dead. What seemed to be a small theory became a theme of many articles in various newspapers. In 1993, McCartney joked about this theory in his live album titling it Paul is Live.

                        People all over Twitter believe that Hillary Clinton has something to do with the tragic events of 9/11. You may ask: what proof do they have? Well, it’s simply because her campaign logo somehow reminds people of 9/11. The theory spread after one newspaper noticed the ‘odd similarities’ and posted the logo on Twitter. Although many believe it has a hidden meaning, some people couldn’t help themselves and pointed out that the logo actually symbolizes, surprisingly enough, the letter H that stands for her name, Hillary. Simply shocking.

According to Erich von Däniken, the author of the book “Chariots of the Gods?” who claims that ‘many ancient megastructures such as Stonehenge, the Egyptian pyramids, and the Moai heads of Easter Island were built using know-how passed down from God-like aliens to mankind.”

                            <p class="txt-contents">The mysterious white lines in Peru known as Nazca lines were created to attract aliens, a new theory claims. The claims were made by website Ranker, and according to them, these designs were made big enough to make it visible from space, so that aliens will get attracted and visit Peru. According to researchers, these lines were drawn as far back as 500 BC, and this large design on the ground depicts the figures of animals like fish and monkeys. Some of the figures even depict human figures - a possible attempt to attract the aliens to our civilization.
